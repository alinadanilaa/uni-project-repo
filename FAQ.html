                A: For a custom made rug, you would have to first contact us
                about the design and dimensions for us to give an approximate price.
                After that, a first payment is required for us to start the production.
                When the rug is finised, the full payment is required for us to deliver it.

                In general, it's best to avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners on your
                tufted product, as this can damage the fibers and affect the texture and appearance of the surface.
                <p>For routine cleaning, vacuuming with a soft brush attachment is usually sufficient to remove dirt and
                    dust. If your tufted product has any stains or spills, it's important to address them promptly to
                    prevent
                    them from setting in.</p>
